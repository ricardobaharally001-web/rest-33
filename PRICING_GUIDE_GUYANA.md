### **SIMPLE: Prices are Whole Dollars**

Unlike some e-commerce systems that use cents, your store uses **whole dollar amounts** because that's how Guyana works!

### Example Prices:

|----------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Twenty dollars | **20** | 20 | **$20** |
| One hundred dollars | **100** | 100 | **$100** |
| Five hundred dollars | **500** | 500 | **$500** |
| Fifteen hundred dollars | **1500** | 1500 | **$1,500** |
| Two thousand dollars | **2000** | 2000 | **$2,000** |
| Five thousand dollars | **5000** | 5000 | **$5,000** |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**
**DO NOT multiply by 100!**

Just enter the actual dollar amount:
- ‚úÖ For GYD $500 ‚Üí Enter **500**
- ‚úÖ For GYD $1,500 ‚Üí Enter **1500**
- ‚ùå For GYD $500 ‚Üí DO NOT enter 50000

## üéØ Recommended Pricing Strategy

### 1. Round to Common Denominations

Since Guyana uses specific bills, round your prices to make change easier:

**For items under $1,000:**
- Round to nearest $20, $50, or $100
- Examples: $500, $600, $800, $1,000

**For items $1,000 - $5,000:**
- Round to nearest $100 or $500
- Examples: $1,500, $2,000, $2,500, $3,000

**For items over $5,000:**
- Round to nearest $1,000
- Examples: $6,000, $8,000, $10,000

### 2. Minimum Price Recommendation

Since the smallest common bill is **$20**, consider setting minimum price at $20 or higher.

### 3. Competitive Pricing

Research local Guyana prices:
- Check local shops
- Check other online Guyana stores
- Check prices in Georgetown markets
- Factor in your delivery costs

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details (For Developers)

### Database Storage

The field is called `price_cents` for historical reasons (compatibility), but it **stores whole dollars**, not cents!

```sql
-- This field stores GYD $1,500 as the number 1500
price_cents INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
```

### Code Usage

```typescript
// Product with GYD $1,500
product.price_cents = 1500  // Whole dollars!

// Display to customer
import { formatPrice } from '@/lib/currency';
formatPrice(1500)  // Returns: "$1,500"
```

### Cart Calculation

```typescript
// Item 1: GYD $1,500 √ó 2 = $3,000
// Item 2: GYD $800 √ó 1 = $800
// Total: $3,800

const total = items.reduce((sum, item) => {
  return sum + (item.price_cents * item.qty);
}, 0);

// total = 3800 (represents GYD $3,800)
formatPrice(total)  // Displays: "$3,800"
```
