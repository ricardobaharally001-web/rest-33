# ✅ PRICING SYSTEM UPDATED FOR GUYANA

## 🎉 What Changed

The pricing system has been **updated to match Guyana's currency system** - **whole dollars only, no cents!**

---

## 🇬🇾 Why This Change?

In Guyana, the common currency bills are:
- **$20** (smallest)
- **$100**
- **$500**
- **$1,000**
- **$2,000**
- **$5,000** (largest common bill)

**There are NO cents in common use in Guyana!**

So your system now works with **whole Guyanese Dollars** - simple and accurate for your market.

## ✅ What's New

### Before (Incorrect for Guyana):
```
To charge GYD $1,500:
❌ Enter: 150000 (multiply by 100)
❌ System stored in "cents"
```

### After (Correct for Guyana):
```
To charge GYD $1,500:
✅ Enter: 1500 (just the dollar amount!)
✅ System stores as whole dollars
```
