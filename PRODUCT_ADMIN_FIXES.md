# 🔧 Product Admin Fixes

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Price Input Bug** - FIXED!
**Problem:** When entering $100.00, it was displaying as $10,000
**Root Cause:** The system was still treating input as cents (multiplying/dividing by 100)
**Solution:** Updated to work with whole dollars only

### 2. **Missing Search Feature** - ADDED!
**Problem:** No way to search for existing products
**Solution:** Added search bar to quickly find products by name or description
